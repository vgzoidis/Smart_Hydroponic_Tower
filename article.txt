1. Introduction
Hydroponics, a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent, has gained significant attention as a sustainable agricultural technique. It offers numerous advantages over traditional agriculture, including higher crop yields, faster growth rates, and reduced water consumption [1]. However, maintaining the optimal conditions for plant growth in a hydroponic system can be a labor-intensive process, requiring frequent monitoring of various environmental and water parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature [2].

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up new possibilities for automating and optimizing agricultural processes [3]. By integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication technologies, it is possible to create "smart" farming systems that can monitor and control the growing environment with minimal human intervention [4].

This paper presents the design, development, and implementation of a Smart Hydroponic Tower, a low-cost, IoT-based system for automated plant growth monitoring and control. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect data from a comprehensive suite of sensors and control pumps for nutrient circulation and pH regulation. A local TFT display provides real-time feedback, while a mobile application allows for remote monitoring and control. The primary goal of this work is to provide a practical and accessible solution for automating hydroponic cultivation, thereby reducing manual labor and improving plant growth outcomes. The main contributions of this work are the development of an integrated hardware and software solution for hydroponic automation, including a custom PCB, an ESP32-based control unit, and a React Native mobile application for remote management.

2. Materials and Methods
The Smart Hydroponic Tower system is composed of three main parts: the physical tower and its associated hardware, the ESP32-based firmware for control and data acquisition, and a mobile application for remote monitoring and management.

2.1. Hardware
The core of the control system is an ESP32-WROOM-32 development board, chosen for its low cost, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, and extensive community support. The ESP32 interfaces with a variety of sensors to monitor the hydroponic environment:
*   **Water Temperature:** A DS18B20 waterproof sensor measures the temperature of the nutrient solution.
*   **pH Level:** A DFRobot SKU-SEN0161 analog pH sensor measures the acidity of the solution.
*   **Electrical Conductivity (EC):** A DFRobot SKU-DFR0300 sensor measures the nutrient concentration.
*   **Water Level:** A non-contact liquid level sensor (SKU-SEN0485) is used to detect the water level in the reservoir and prevent the pumps from running dry.
*   **Ambient Temperature and Humidity:** A DHT22 sensor monitors the environmental conditions around the tower.
*   **Light Level:** A BH1750 digital light sensor measures the ambient light intensity.
*   **CO2 Level:** An MH-Z19B NDIR sensor measures the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air.

A 2.4" ST7789 TFT display is used to provide a local user interface, showing real-time sensor readings and system status. The system controls three peristaltic pumps: one for circulating the nutrient solution and two for dispensing pH up/down solutions to maintain the desired pH level. A custom-designed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was created to provide a compact and reliable solution for connecting all the components (Figure 1).

2.2. ESP32 Firmware
The firmware for the ESP32 was developed using the Arduino framework in PlatformIO. The code is modular, with separate files for handling sensors, the display, pump control, Wi-Fi connectivity, and data logging.

The `sensors.cpp` module is responsible for initializing and reading data from all the sensors. To ensure stable readings, a moving average filter is applied to the analog pH sensor data. The `display.cpp` module manages the TFT display, rendering real-time data and status indicators with color codes (green for optimal, yellow for warning, red for critical).

The `pump_control.cpp` module implements the logic for automated pump cycling and pH control. The main circulation pump operates on a configurable timer (defaulting to 15 minutes on, 45 minutes off). The pH control system uses a feedback loop to maintain the pH within a target range, activating the pH up or down pumps as needed.

The `wifi_server.cpp` module handles the Wi-Fi connection and sets up an asynchronous web server. This server exposes a JSON API for retrieving real-time sensor data and provides a simple web page for manual control of the system.

Finally, the `data_logger.cpp` module is responsible for logging sensor data to a Supabase cloud database every five minutes. This allows for long-term data storage and analysis. The database schema is defined in the `supabase_schema.sql` file.

2.3. Mobile Application
A mobile application for Android was developed using React Native. The app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Smart Hydroponic Tower. It features three main screens:
*   **Dashboard:** Displays real-time sensor data, a visualization of the tower, and manual pump controls (Figure 2a).
*   **Plotting:** Shows historical data from the Supabase database in interactive charts, allowing users to visualize trends over different time periods (day, week, month) (Figure 2b).
*   **Settings:** Allows users to configure the pump automation cycles and pH control parameters.

The application communicates with the ESP32 via its JSON API for real-time data and control, and it fetches historical data directly from the Supabase backend.

3. Results
The Smart Hydroponic Tower system was successfully assembled and tested. The system demonstrated reliable and autonomous operation, maintaining the set parameters for the hydroponic environment.

3.1. Real-time Monitoring and Control
The local TFT display provided a clear and immediate overview of the system's status, with color-coded indicators for each sensor reading. The web interface and the mobile application both allowed for successful remote monitoring and control of the system. Users were able to view live sensor data and manually operate the pumps from a web browser or the Android app.

3.2. Automated Systems
The automated pump cycling and pH control systems functioned as designed. The circulation pump correctly followed its on/off schedule, and the pH control system was able to maintain the pH of the nutrient solution within the specified target range. The system's logic successfully prevented the pumps from operating when the water level was low, protecting them from damage.

3.3. Data Logging and Visualization
The system successfully logged data to the Supabase cloud database at regular intervals. The mobile application's plotting screen was able to retrieve and display this data, providing valuable insights into the historical performance of the system and the growing conditions of the plants.

3.4. System Visualization
The project includes a variety of visual materials that document its construction and operation. These include screenshots of the mobile application (Figure 2), photos of the custom PCB (Figure 1), and images of the fully assembled system.

4. Discussion
The Smart Hydroponic Tower project successfully demonstrates the application of IoT technologies to automate and optimize hydroponic agriculture. By integrating a range of sensors and actuators with an ESP32 microcontroller, the system provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling the key parameters of a hydroponic environment.

The use of a mobile application for remote management significantly enhances the user experience, allowing for convenient access to real-time data and control functions. The cloud-based data logging provides a powerful tool for data analysis, enabling growers to make informed decisions and optimize their cultivation strategies over time.

The modular design of both the hardware and software makes the system flexible and extensible. Future work could involve the integration of additional sensors (e.g., for specific nutrient ions), the development of more sophisticated control algorithms (e.g., using machine learning to predict plant needs), and the expansion of the mobile application to include features like push notifications for alerts and more advanced data analysis tools.

5. Conclusions
This paper has presented a low-cost, IoT-based Smart Hydroponic Tower that automates the process of plant growth monitoring and control. The system, which includes a custom PCB, an ESP32-based control unit, and a React Native mobile application, provides a practical and effective solution for maintaining optimal growing conditions in a hydroponic setup. The successful implementation and testing of the system highlight the potential of IoT technologies to revolutionize agriculture, making it more efficient, data-driven, and accessible.
